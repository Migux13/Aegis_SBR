-- Class_Rogue_UI  -  rogue window body for Aegis_SBR
-- Builds and binds only the rogue specific controls. The shared
-- window shell and profile management live in Aegis_SBR_UI.lua.
-- Uses the shell's scroll layout (M.useScrollLayout): BuildBody is
-- handed the scroll child and the cursor-based layout API places
-- everything; detail lives in tooltips so labels stay short.

-- Four tabs, because the three specs are played nothing like each other and a
-- single flat list forced every rogue to read past two thirds of it. The rail
-- itself is the shared one (Aegis_SBR_UI:BuildSpecTabs); a class only declares
-- the tabs and tags its sections.
--
-- IMPORTANT: these tabs are a VIEW. Switching one changes what is on screen and
-- nothing else - the rotation does not read cfg.spec, so a setting you turned on
-- stays on while a tab does not show it. That is deliberate: a tab that silently
-- disabled options would be a second, invisible set of switches. The Starter tab
-- is safe under that rule because everything it hides is either off by default or
-- a spell a rogue under twenty cannot cast yet.
